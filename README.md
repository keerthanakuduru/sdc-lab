Use HTML and CSS to create a shopping cart layout with Flexbox and Grid features.

Creating a Responsive Shopping Cart Interface

Apply Bootstrap to make the shopping cart design adaptable to different devices.

Form Validation Functionality

Use JavaScript for performing client-side form input validation to ensure proper data entry.

Weather App with Data Visualization

Fetch weather data using Fetch API and visualize it on the browser using Chart.js.

Java CRUD Application

Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations in the database using Java, JDBC, and MySQL.

Connecting Java Servlet to a Database

Establish a connection between Java Servlets, JSP pages, and the database for backend communication.

Session Management in Java Servlet

Handle user sessions and maintain state using Java Servlet's session tracking features.

Building a Basic Node.js Server

Create a simple HTTP server using Node.js core modules (without Express).

RESTful API Development for Student Data

Develop a REST API to manage student records using Node.js and Express.js.

JWT-based Secure Authentication API

Implement a login and authentication mechanism using JWT tokens in a Node.js environment.

Building a Single Page Application (SPA) with React.js

Create a React.js SPA featuring form handling and navigation using React Router.

React Weather Dashboard with Data Visualization

Fetch and display weather data in a React app using Chart.js and OpenWeatherMap API.

Django Weather Web Application

Build a weather tracking web app using Django and Chart.js for data presentation.

Django Student Management System

Design a full CRUD-based student database management app using the Django framework.

Simple React TODO Application

Develop a task management app in React.js, using states and components.

Django TODO List Application

Create a TODO list manager in Django, handling task creation, updating, and deletion.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run Each Experiment:
Frontend Tasks (HTML/CSS/JS):
Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

Node.js Applications:

Navigate to the project folder.

Run npm install to install dependencies.

Start the server using node <file_name>.js.

Django Projects:
Use the command python manage.py runserver to launch the development server.

Java Projects:
Compile Java files using javac and run the classes with java <ClassName>.

üåç External APIs & Tools Used:
OpenWeatherMap API: For real-time weather data.

Chart.js: For generating interactive charts.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens): To provide secure login and session handling.

MySQL/Oracle: Relational databases for backend data storage.

üéì Recommended Learning Path:
Start with Basics:
Focus on the frontend experiments (1‚Äì4) to get familiar with HTML, CSS, and JS.

Move to Backend Fundamentals:
Explore Java, Node.js, and API handling (5‚Äì10) to understand server-side development.

Advance to Modern Web Apps:
